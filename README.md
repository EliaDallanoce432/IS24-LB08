### Introduction
This project is the implementation of the board game "Codex Naturalis". It's a client-server application that manages multiple clients connected to a single server. Each game has a maximum of 4 players and a server can host multiple games. Each client interacts with the server with a GUI.
### MVC pattern

The MVC is a software design pattern used for developing user interfaces that
divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

The precompiled jar can be used to run this application.

You can run the **Codex client GUI application** either by double-clicking on the **CodexClientGui.bat** file found in "Deliveries" or running the following command: `java -jar .\LBO8.jar client`.

To run the **Codex Server application**, double-click the **CodexServer.bat** file or running `java -jar .\LB08 server`.
